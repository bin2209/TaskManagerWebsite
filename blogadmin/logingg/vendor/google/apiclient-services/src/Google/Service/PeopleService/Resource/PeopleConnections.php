   * Provides a list of the authenticated user's contacts. The request returns a
   * 400 error if `personFields` is not specified. The request returns a 410 error
   * if `sync_token` is specified and is expired. Sync tokens expire after 7 days.
   * A request without `sync_token` should be made and all contacts should be
   * synced. (connections.listPeopleConnections)
   *
   * @param string $resourceName Required. The resource name to return connections
   * for. Only `people/me` is valid.
   * @param array $optParams Optional parameters.
   *
   * @opt_param int pageSize Optional. The number of connections to include in the
   * response. Valid values are between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Defaults to 100 if
   * not set or set to 0.
   * @opt_param string pageToken Optional. A page token, received from a previous
   * `ListConnections` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When
   * paginating, all other parameters provided to `ListConnections` must match the
   * call that provided the page token.
   * @opt_param string personFields Required. A field mask to restrict which
   * fields on each person are returned. Multiple fields can be specified by
   * separating them with commas. Valid values are: * addresses * ageRanges *
   * biographies * birthdays * calendarUrls * clientData * coverPhotos *
   * emailAddresses * events * externalIds * genders * imClients * interests *
   * locales * locations * memberships * metadata * miscKeywords * names *
   * nicknames * occupations * organizations * phoneNumbers * photos * relations *
   * sipAddresses * skills * urls * userDefined
   * @opt_param string requestMask.includeField Required. Comma-separated list of
   * person fields to be included in the response. Each path should start with
   * `person.`: for example, `person.names` or `person.photos`.
   * @opt_param bool requestSyncToken Optional. Whether the response should
   * include `next_sync_token` on the last page, which can be used to get all
   * changes since the last request. For subsequent sync requests use the
   * `sync_token` param instead. Initial sync requests that specify
   * `request_sync_token` have an additional rate limit.
   * @opt_param string sortOrder Optional. The order in which the connections
   * should be sorted. Defaults to `LAST_MODIFIED_ASCENDING`.
   * @opt_param string sources Optional. A mask of what source types to return.
   * Defaults to READ_SOURCE_TYPE_CONTACT and READ_SOURCE_TYPE_PROFILE if not set.
   * @opt_param string syncToken Optional. A sync token, received from a previous
   * `ListConnections` call. Provide this to retrieve only the resources changed
   * since the last request. Sync requests that specify `sync_token` have an
   * additional rate limit. When syncing, all other parameters provided to
   * `ListConnections` must match the call that provided the sync token.
